**Describe changes**

In a list, describe the changes you made. This should be more granular than the description at the beginning of the PR. These descriptions can be short, but this would also be the place to describe why something seemingly unrelated was included. e.g.,

> - added tests of new model
> - added docs describing new model
> - updated old tests for new API
> - small change to synthesis to be compatible with new API
> - while implementing this, a new version of torch was released, which required a small update to perceptual_distance.py

**Benchmarking**

If your test involves improvements to the efficiency of any part of the code base, please include some benchmarking results, to show the performance before (i.e., in the `main` branch) and after. See [PR #377](https://github.com/plenoptic-org/plenoptic/pull/377) for an example.
