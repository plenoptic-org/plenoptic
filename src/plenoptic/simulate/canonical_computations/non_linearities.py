    Spatially local gain control.

    Compute the local energy and phase of a real-valued tensor.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x
        Tensor of shape (batch, channel, height, width).
    epsilon
        Small constant to avoid division by zero.

    Returns
    -------

    Notes
    -----
    Norm and direction (analogous to complex modulus and phase) are defined using

    frequencies introduced by the squaring operation. In the complex case adding the
    quadrature pair response has the same effect (note that this is most clearly seen in
    the frequency domain). Here computing the direction (phase) reduces to dividing out
    the norm (modulus), indeed the signal only has one real component. This is a
    normalization operation (local unit vector), hence the connection to local gain
    control.
