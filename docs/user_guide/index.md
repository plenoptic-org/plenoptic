# User Guide

These sections demonstrate how to use plenoptic in a variety of contexts.

Users are encouraged to read the introductions for the [synthesis method](synthesis/index) or [model / metric](models_and_metrics/index) they would like to use.

The [](reproduce/index) section includes examples of how to use plenoptic to reproduce results from published papers.

Finally, the [](advanced/index) section describes some more complicated ways of interacting with plenoptic, which may be helpful for advanced users.
