# User Guide

These sections demonstrate how to use plenoptic in a variety of contexts.

Users are encouraged to read the introductions for the [synthesis method](synthesis-index) or [model / metric](models-metrics-index) they would like to use.

The [](reproduce-index) section includes examples of how to use plenoptic to reproduce results from published papers.

Finally, the [](advanced-index) section describes some more complicated ways of interacting with plenoptic, which may be helpful for advanced users.
