# Portilla-Simoncelli Texture Model

The following notebooks introduce the Portilla-Simoncelli texture model, as first described in {cite:alp}`Portilla2000-param-textur`, and its implementation in plenoptic.

If you are familiar with the model and its [matlab implementation](https://github.com/LabForComputationalVision/textureSynth), start with [](ps-basic-synth) and check out [](ps-mat-diffs) to see how to use the model in plenoptic and the differences between the two implementations.

If you are planning on synthesizing Portilla-Simoncelli texture metamers for your own research, please read [](ps-optimization) and [](ps-limitations).

:class: warning

We strongly recommended reading [the metamers tutorial](metamer-nb) before the notebooks found on this page, as they already assume a basic understanding of metamers.
