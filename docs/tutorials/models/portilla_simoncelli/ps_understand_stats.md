# Understanding Portilla-Simoncelli model statistics

The Portilla-Simoncelli consists of a few different classes of statistics:

- Marginal Statistics.  These include pixel statistics (mean, variance, skew, kurtosis, and range of the pixel values), as well as the skewness and kurtosis of the lowpass images computed at each level of the recursive pyramid decomposition.
- Auto-Correlation Statistics.  These include the auto-correlation of the real-valued pyramid bands, as well as the auto-correlation of the magnitude of the pyramid bands, and the mean of the magnitude of the pyramid bands.
- Cross-Correlation Statistics.  These include correlations across scale and across orientation bands of the pyramid (both for the real values of the pyramid and for the magnitude of the pyramid bands).

The original paper uses synthesis to demonstrate the role of these different types of statistics.  They show that the statistics can be used to constrain a synthesis optimization to generate new examples of textures.  They also show that the absence of subsets of statistics results in synthesis failures.  Here we replicate those results.

:::{admonition} Reproducibility
:class: warning

Due to pytorch's limitations, we [cannot guarantee perfect reproducibility](reproduce). However, the steps shown below have, in our experience, reliably led to good model metamers synthesized in a reasonable length of time for a variety of images, and they are what we suggest. If you use follow these basic steps and **are not** able to successfully synthesize a good model metamer, please post on our [discussion board](https://github.com/plenoptic-org/plenoptic/discussions/) and we'll try to help!

See [](ps-optimization) for more information about the specific decisions taken around optimization, including what "good" means.

```

:::{attention}
This notebook contains many metamers and, while any one synthesis operation does not take too long, all of them combined result in a lengthy notebook. Therefore, we have cached the result of most of these syntheses online and only download them for investigation in this notebook.

Additionally, while you can normally call {func}`~plenoptic.synthesize.metamer.Metamer.synthesize` again to pick up where we left out, the cached version of the results discarded the optimizer's state dict (to reduce the size on disk). Thus, calling `met.synthesize(100)` with one of our cached and loaded metamer objects **will not** give the same result as calling `met.synthesize(200)` with a new metamer object initialized as shown in this notebook.

:::

In order to do reproduce those results, we create a version of the Portilla Simoncelli model where certain statistics can be turned off. If you are interested in the implementation, see the following dropdown.

## Pixel Statistics + Marginal statistics

Beginning with some of the pixel and marginal statistics, we'll demonstrate synthesis both with and without combinations of statistics.

To start, we'll remove the following statistics:

- the pixel statistics: mean, variance, skew, kurtosis, minimum, and maximum of the original image.
- skew and kurtosis on the lowpass images computed at each level of the recursive pyramid.

These statistics play an important role constraining the histogram of pixel intensities to match across the original and synthesized image.

(See figure 3 of {cite:alp}`Portilla2000-param-textur`.)

```{code-cell} ipython3
# which statistics to remove
remove_statistics = [
    "pixel_statistics",
    "skew_reconstructed",
    "kurtosis_reconstructed",
]

# run on fig3a or fig3b to replicate paper
fig_name = "fig3b"
img = po.tools.load_images(IMG_PATH / f"{fig_name}.jpg")
img = img.to(DEVICE).to(torch.float64)

# synthesis with full PortillaSimoncelli model
model = po.simul.PortillaSimoncelli(img.shape[-2:]).to(DEVICE)
loss = po.tools.optim.portilla_simoncelli_loss_factory(model, img)
# to avoid running so many syntheses in this notebook, we load a cached version. see the
# following admonition for how to run this yourself
met = po.synth.Metamer(
    img,
    model,
    loss_function=loss,
)
met.load(CACHE_DIR / f"ps_remove_{fig_name}_remove-False.pt", map_location=DEVICE)

# synthesis with pixel and marginal statistics absent
model_remove = PortillaSimoncelliRemove(
    img.shape[-2:], remove_keys=remove_statistics
).to(DEVICE)
loss_remove = po.tools.optim.portilla_simoncelli_loss_factory(model_remove, img)
met_remove = po.synth.Metamer(
    img,
    model_remove,
    loss_function=loss_remove,
)
met_remove.load(CACHE_DIR / f"ps_remove_{fig_name}_remove-True.pt", map_location=DEVICE)
```

:::{admonition} How to run these syntheses manually
:class: dropdown note

```{code-block} python
:name: test_ps_remove
opt_kwargs = {
    "max_iter": 10,
    "max_eval": 10,
    "history_size": 100,

}

```

Call the {func}`~plenoptic.synthesize.metamer.Metamer.setup` and {func}`~plenoptic.synthesize.metamer.Metamer.synthesize` methods of `met_remove` with the same arguments.

:::

In the following figure, we can see that not only does the metamer created with all statistics look more like the target image than the one created without the marginal statistics, but its pixel intensity histogram is much more similar to that of the target image.

```{code-cell} ipython3
# visualize results
fig = po.imshow(
    [met.image, met.metamer, met_remove.metamer],
    title=["Target image", "Full Statistics", "Without Marginal Statistics"],
    vrange="auto1",

fig.add_axes([0.33, -1, 0.33, 0.9])
fig.add_axes([0.67, -1, 0.33, 0.9])
# this helper function expects a metamer object. see the metamer notebook for details.
po.synth.metamer.plot_pixel_values(met, ax=fig.axes[3])
fig.axes[3].set_title("Full statistics")
po.synth.metamer.plot_pixel_values(met_remove, ax=fig.axes[4])
fig.axes[4].set_title("Without marginal statistics")
```

## Coefficient Correlations

In this section, we'll replicate examples of synthesis failures with the following statistics removed:

- local auto-correlations of the lowpass images computed at each level of the recursive pyramid

These statistics play a role in representing periodic structures and long-range correlations. For example, in the image named `fig4b.jpg` (the tile pattern) the absence of these statistics causes results in more difficulty synthesizing the long, continuous lines that stretch from one end of the image to the other.

(See figure 4 of {cite:alp}`Portilla2000-param-textur`.)

```{code-cell} ipython3
# which statistics to remove. note that, in the original paper, std_reconstructed is
# implicitly contained within auto_correlation_reconstructed, view the section on
# differences between plenoptic and matlab implementation for details
remove_statistics = ["auto_correlation_reconstructed", "std_reconstructed"]

# run on fig4a or fig4b to replicate paper
fig_name = "fig4b"
img = po.tools.load_images(IMG_PATH / f"{fig_name}.jpg")
img = img.to(DEVICE).to(torch.float64)

# We reuse the model and loss definition from the first section; the only difference
# is the image.
met = po.synth.Metamer(
    img,
    model,
    loss_function=loss,
)
met.load(CACHE_DIR / f"ps_remove_{fig_name}_remove-False.pt", map_location=DEVICE)

# synthesis with coefficient correlations absent. we have to reinitialize the model and
# the loss because we're removing a different set of statistics.
model_remove = PortillaSimoncelliRemove(
    img.shape[-2:], remove_keys=remove_statistics
).to(DEVICE)
loss_remove = po.tools.optim.portilla_simoncelli_loss_factory(model_remove, img)
met_remove = po.synth.Metamer(
    img,
    model_remove,
    loss_function=loss_remove,
)
met_remove.load(CACHE_DIR / f"ps_remove_{fig_name}_remove-True.pt", map_location=DEVICE)
```

:::{admonition} How to run these syntheses manually
:class: dropdown note

```{code-block} python
:name: test_ps_remove
opt_kwargs = {
    "max_iter": 10,
    "max_eval": 10,
    "history_size": 100,
    "line_search_fn": "strong_wolfe",
    "lr": 1,
}
met.setup(optimizer=torch.optim.LBFGS, optimizer_kwargs=opt_kwargs)
met.synthesize(max_iter=100)
```

Call the {func}`~plenoptic.synthesize.metamer.Metamer.setup` and {func}`~plenoptic.synthesize.metamer.Metamer.synthesize` methods of `met_remove` with the same arguments.

:::

```{code-cell} ipython3
# visualize results
po.imshow(
    [met.image, met.metamer, met_remove.metamer],
    title=[
        "Target image",
        "Full Statistics",
        "Without Correlation Statistics",
    ],
    vrange="auto1",
);
```

And we can double check the error plots to see the difference in their representations. The first figure shows the error for the metamer created without the correlation statistics (at right above), while the second shows the error for the metamer created with all statistics (center), and we can see that larger error in the first plot in the middle row in the first figure, especially the center plot, `auto_correlation_reconstructed`, since these statistics are unconstrained for the synthesis done by `met_remove`. (Note we have to use `model` <!-- skip-lint -->, not `model_remove` to create these plots, since `model_remove` doesn't contain them.)

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, _ = model.plot_representation(
    model(met_remove.metamer) - model(met.image),
    figsize=(15, 5),
    ylim=(-4, 4),
)
fig.suptitle("Without Correlation Statistics")

fig, _ = model.plot_representation(
    model(met.metamer) - model(met.image),
    figsize=(15, 5),
    ylim=(-4, 4),
)
fig.suptitle("Full statistics")
```

## Magnitude Correlation

In this section, we'll replicate examples of synthesis failures with the following statistics removed:

- correlation of the complex magnitude of pairs of coefficients at adjacent positions, orientations and scales.

These statistics play a role constraining high contrast locations to be organized along lines and edges across all scales. For example, in the image named `fig6b.jpg` the absence of these statistics results in a completely different organization of the orientation content in the edges.

(See figure 6 of {cite:alp}`Portilla2000-param-textur`.)

```{code-cell} ipython3
# which statistics to remove. note that, in the original paper, magnitude_std is
# implicitly contained within auto_correlation_magnitude, view the section on
# differences between plenoptic and matlab implementation for details.
remove_statistics = [
    "magnitude_std",
    "cross_orientation_correlation_magnitude",
    "cross_scale_correlation_magnitude",
    "auto_correlation_magnitude",
]

# run on fig6a or fig6b to replicate paper
fig_name = "fig6b"
img = po.tools.load_images(IMG_PATH / f"{fig_name}.jpg")
img = img.to(DEVICE).to(torch.float64)

# We reuse the model and loss definition from the previous section; the only difference
# is the image.
met = po.synth.Metamer(
    img,
    model,
    loss_function=loss,
)
met.load(CACHE_DIR / f"ps_remove_{fig_name}_remove-False.pt", map_location=DEVICE)


# synthesis with pixel and marginal statistics absent
model_remove = PortillaSimoncelliRemove(
    img.shape[-2:], remove_keys=remove_statistics
).to(DEVICE)
loss_remove = po.tools.optim.portilla_simoncelli_loss_factory(model_remove, img)
met_remove = po.synth.Metamer(
    img,
    model_remove,
    loss_function=loss_remove,
)
met_remove.load(CACHE_DIR / f"ps_remove_{fig_name}_remove-True.pt", map_location=DEVICE)
```

```

And again, let's look at the error plots. The first figure shows the error for the metamer created without the correlation statistics (at right above), while the second shows the error for the metamer created with all statistics (center), and we can see that larger error in the plot scorresponding to `auto_correlation_magnitude`, `cross_orientation_correlation_magnitude`, and `cross_scale_correlation_magnitude`., since these statistics are unconstrained for the synthesis done by `met_remove`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
fig, _ = model.plot_representation(
    model(met_remove.metamer) - model(met.image),
    figsize=(15, 5),
    ylim=(-2, 2),
)
fig.suptitle("Without Correlation Statistics")

fig, _ = model.plot_representation(
    model(met.metamer) - model(met.image),
    figsize=(15, 5),
    ylim=(-2, 2),
)
fig.suptitle("Full statistics");
```

## Cross-scale Phase Statistics

In this section, we'll replicate examples of synthesis failures with the following statistics removed:

- relative phase of coefficients of bands at adjacent scales

These statistics play a role constraining high contrast locations to be organized along lines and edges across all scales. These phase statistics are important in representing textures with strong illumination effects. When they are removed, the synthesized images appear much less three dimensional and lose the detailed structure of shadows.

(See figure 8 of {cite:alp}`Portilla2000-param-textur`.)

```{code-cell} ipython3
# which statistics to remove
remove_statistics = ["cross_scale_correlation_real"]

# run on fig8a and fig8b to replicate paper
fig_name = "fig8b"
img = po.tools.load_images(IMG_PATH / f"{fig_name}.jpg")
img = img.to(DEVICE).to(torch.float64)

# We reuse the model and loss definition from the first section; the only difference
# is the image.
met = po.synth.Metamer(
    img,
    model,
    loss_function=loss,
)
met.load(CACHE_DIR / f"ps_remove_{fig_name}_remove-False.pt", map_location=DEVICE)

# synthesis with pixel and marginal statistics absent
model_remove = PortillaSimoncelliRemove(
    img.shape[-2:], remove_keys=remove_statistics
).to(DEVICE)
loss_remove = po.tools.optim.portilla_simoncelli_loss_factory(model_remove, img)
met_remove = po.synth.Metamer(
    img,
    model_remove,
    loss_function=loss_remove,
)
met_remove.load(CACHE_DIR / f"ps_remove_{fig_name}_remove-True.pt", map_location=DEVICE)
```
